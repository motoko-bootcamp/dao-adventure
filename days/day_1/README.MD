# Day 1Ô∏è‚É£

## Introduction

Welcome to the [Mzansi Web3 Bootcamp](https://twitter.com/icphub_SA), where great minds like yours gather to learn and master the art of programming on the **Internet Computer**.

Today marks your exciting first day, and while it may be intense, take the chance to bond with your teammates and brace yourself for the adventure ahead. <br/>

Don't worry if you fall behind; allow yourself the time needed to grasp the material. Keep in mind that 10 days is a brief period to learn everything there is to know about **Web 3.0** and the **Internet Computer**. All resources will be available during and after the bootcamp period, so you can catch-up on anything you've missed.
Above all, the most vital aspect of the Bootcamp is to have fun and learn how to build - let's learn and all grow together.

## Motoko pill üíä

> Before deciding to call it Motoko, the language developed by DFINITY for the Internet Computer was actually called ActorScript. The name was changed to Motoko in 2019 and was inspired by the character Motoko Kusanagi from the anime Ghost in the Shell.
