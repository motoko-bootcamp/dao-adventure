# Chapter 1: Introduction to web3 and blockchain technology.

## Why are we here?

No, this isn't a metaphysical question. We're not about to unravel the secrets of the universe or explain the meaning of life, though that would be an interesting subject for another day. Instead, we're here to dive into the world of Web3 and Blockchain technology and the Internet Computer. Our goal? To show you how to build innovative and really cool decentralized applications that can solve real-world problems on the blockchain.

We're going to guide you through the first steps of your blockchain tech learning journey. By the end, you'll be fully equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to start building impactful projects that can change the world for the better, the Web3 way. How cool is that!

## What is web3?

To understand web3, first you need to understand what web1 and web2 are.

Web1 is the first generation of the World Wide Web revolution. Consisting of a few people creating web pages and content and web pages for a large group of readers, allowing them to access facts, information, and content from the sources. It was static and fully reliant on humans for content creation and maintenance. This meant that websites were slow to update with new information and weren’t easily accessible to all. In web1, you could only read your Data.

Web2 is the second generation of the web, which emerged in the early 2000s. Web2 is characterized by user-generated content, social media, cloud computing, and mobile applications. Web2 enabled users to become active participants on the internet, creating, sharing, and consuming information.

However, Web2 also created some problems, such as:

- Centralization: A few giant corporations (such as Google, Facebook, Amazon) dominate the web, controlling the data, content, and algorithms that shape our online experience.

- Monetization: Users usually do not benefit from the value they create on the web, while platforms extract profits from advertising and data mining.

- Censorship: Platforms have the power to censor, manipulate, or deplatform users and content that do not align with their interests or policies.

- Security: Users’ data and privacy are vulnerable to hacking, surveillance, or misuse by third parties.

## Now, What is Web3?

Web3 is the third generation of the web, which is still in development. Web3 is based on decentralized technologies such as blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs. Web3 aims to create a more open, fair, and democratic internet, where users have more control and ownership over their data, content, and identity.

Some of the features of Web3 include:

- Decentralization: The web is distributed across a network of nodes that operate without intermediaries or central authorities.

- DAOs: Users can form and govern decentralized autonomous organizations that operate according to predefined rules and incentives.

- Smart contracts: Users can execute and enforce agreements without intermediaries or trust issues.

- Tokenization: Users can create and exchange digital tokens that represent value, such as currency, assets, or access rights.

- NFTs: Users can create and own unique digital items that are verifiable, scarce, and non-fungible (meaning they cannot be replaced or duplicated).


Okay, but I still don't really understand what blockchain is!

At it's core, a blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public database running across many computers/nodes, secured by cryptography. It grows by adding new blocks, which are linked to a 'chain' of previously created blocks. Blockchains have evolved over time, Today, “blockchain” is treated as shorthand for the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies and digital token systems, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum or the Internet Cmputer. Although blockchains can be used as an immutable record of financial transactions, this is far from their only use. In fact, any type of information can be added to a blockchain and in the past everything from virtual kittens to sushi and rare art has been stored on a distributed ledger, and now thanks to the Internet Computer, you can now build and host entire full stack applications fully on chain. Blockchain technology have been around for longer time than what most people realise, the world’s oldest blockchain predates Bitcoin by 13 years and it’s been hiding in plain sight, printed weekly in the classified section of one of the world’s most widely circulated newspapers: The New York Times.

## Now, let's address the Internet Computer.

In essence, the Internet Computer is a public decentralized and distributed cloud platform powered by blockchain technology that is open to anyone, anywhere in the world, and it is permissionless, meaning that anyone can build and deploy applications on the network without needing to seek approval from a central authority. There are blockchain networks like Bitcoin, with its primary goal which is being to be digital gold, a decentralized currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions, Etherium, which extends to being a platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, and a lot of other smart contract networks like Solana, NEAR protocol etc, and then comes the Internet Computer, it's a blockchain platform that allows building smart contracts, known as Canisters on IC, but on IC they are smart contracts on steriods because on the IC smart contracts/Canisters can hold storage of upto 400 Gig at the moment, creating oppotunities to build dapps that are hosted fully on chain, from the backend and data to the frontend with your favourites frontend framworks like React, nextjs, vue.js etc. Rather than competing with existing blockchain networks, the Internet Computer complements them, offering new avenues for application development and deployment.
