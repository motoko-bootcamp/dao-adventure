> This repository contains the starter code for the DAO Adventure project. You are required to complete the code across all 7 chapters.

## Welcome 👋 
Welcome to the DAO Adventure a course designed to teach you how to create a **DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) from scratch on the **Internet Computer** platform, with the **Motoko** programming language.

DAOs are a major innovation, changing governance. Just like the **steam engine** made the **Industrial Revolution** possible by harnessing physical power, **DAOs** harness political power and make a **Web3 revolution** possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize society and resources, with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing and collaborative civilization.

This future is only possible if enough builders learn how to harness the power of **DAOs**. That's why your goal, if you wish to earn your **Motoko Bootcamp Diploma**, is to build a **DAO**.
