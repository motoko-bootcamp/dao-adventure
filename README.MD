### Source code 🧑‍💻

The source code of the project is located in the `src` folder. This is where you'll be writing your code.
This folders also contains two files `account.mo` and `http.mo` that you should not modify, those files are imported in the `src/main.mo` file to help you get started.

## How to graduate? 🎓

To graduate from Motoko Bootcamp, you need to complete all the levels of the bootcamp. Each level is a set of tasks that you need to complete. To complete a task, you need to implement the missing code in the `src/main.mo` file. Once you're done, you can run the tests to check if your code is correct. To run the tests, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mops test level-n
```

With n being the number of the level you want to test.

Once you've succesfuly passed the local test, it's time to put your canister to the real test, on the Internet Computer. To do so, you need to deploy your canister on the Internet Computer and verify it using the online dashboard on [Motoko Bootcamp](https://www.motokobootcamp.com/).

Head over to the **submit** section and submit the id of the canister you've deployed on the Internet Computer. If your canister passes the tests, you'll be able to move on to the next level.
